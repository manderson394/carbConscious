# Weekly Reflection

### Week 1

1/21/2020 - 4 hours

Tasks Completed:
* VM Environment Setup
* Individual Project Selection

I'm pretty confident I want to go with my idea for an open source carbohydrate counting web application for establishments without nutrition information available on the web. 
I don't have a clear idea yet of the screen design, but I generally have my user cases. 

When looking for services that could fit my need, I did find at least one:

* I found an api that grabs [US Restaurant Menus](www.rapidapi.com/restaurantmenus/api/us-restaurant-menus).
* Seems like [www.rapidapi.com] could be a good website if I need to find some other api that are available. 

### Week 2

1/28/2020 - ### hours

Tasks Completed:
* Individual Project:
    * Problem Statement Written
    * Time Log file created
    * Weekly Reflection file created
    * User Stories created
    * High Level Directories Created (*on VM only*)
    * Exercise 2 Completed

I'm still stuck on a Java version exception when trying to configure the week 1 exercise to work on my Windows laptop; I'd like to have that resolved soon so I don't need to use my VM at home.
That being said, my VM is working fine at the moment, and I've been making solid progress in terms of supporting documents to the project (weekly reflection, time logging, problem statement).
My biggest struggle this week was navigating the code I needed for the front end behavior I wanted; I anticipate this will be a continued trend since it isn't my strength.
I'm actually looking forward to getting more familiar with front end development through this project, though. 

Aside from week 3 work, I really want to focus on rounding out my project design in the upcoming week.
